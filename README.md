## Description

The CS50 Book Review Blog allows users to read and create book reviews. Whether you're looking for book recommendations or want to share your thoughts on a particular book, this platform has got you covered.

I chose to build this website using the MERN stack because of my preference for JavaScript over Python. This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how the frontend and backend of websites work, as well as the implementation of authentication mechanisms.

Key features of the project include:

- **Login Function:** Users can create an account and log in to the platform.
- **Authentication with JWT:** User authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Protected Routes:** Certain routes are protected, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.
- **User-Generated Book Reviews:** Users can create their own book reviews, sharing their opinions and insights.
- **Read Reviews without an Account:** Even without an account, visitors can read existing book reviews.
- **Editing Existing Reviews:** Users have the ability to edit their own book reviews.

I incorporated the knowledge and experience gained from my previous finance project into the development of this website. It has been an exciting journey, and I am thrilled with the progress I have made.

Feel free to explore the CS50 Book Review Blog, read book reviews, and even create your own reviews. Your feedback and participation are highly appreciated.
